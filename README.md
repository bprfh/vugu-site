## TODO:

* Finish writing docs

* Put in some basic server-side rendering

* Consider making the convention be main_wasm.go, since the same package could be used in different ways DONE

* What about a live preview system that lets you edit components and see the output in-browser!...

* Deploy to production (HTTPS with LE would be nice).  Do a brief hit on the dev vs prod webserver stuff in vugu while we're at it, including an example of a build script for production.

* Clean up the github readme and make it all pretty, maybe with a graphic.
